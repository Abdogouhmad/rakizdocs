## Navbar Redesign

A new redesign has been applied to the app’s navigation bar to improve both usability and visual consistency.

This update introduces a cleaner layout and smoother interactions by leveraging a dedicated Flutter package.

## Package & Effect

The navigation bar is now implemented using the **Google Nav Bar** Flutter package:

This package provides customizable animations, modern styling, and better feedback for user interactions.
